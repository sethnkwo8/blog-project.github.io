                        <p>Manchester Magistrates' Court was told the charges related to alleged attacks in Macclesfield in July and August.

Mr Mendy, who was wearing a cream sweatshirt and spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth, appeared via video-link and remains in custody.

In August, the 27-year-old, of Prestbury, was charged with four counts of rape and one of sexual assault.

Those previous charges related to alleged attacks on three women over the age of 16 at Mr Mendy's home between October 2020 and August 2021.

The France international, who has been in custody since August after a number of bail applications were refused by judges, has played for Manchester City since 2017, when he joined from Monaco for a reported £52m.</p>

That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
